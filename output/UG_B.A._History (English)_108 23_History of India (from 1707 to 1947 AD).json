This misinterpretation of the firman became a constant cause of dispute between the Nawabs of Bengal and the Company.

Hence, it is natural that they wanted to consolidate their position further in Bengal. They wanted to base their operations in Calcutta. There were other European contenders too in Bengal, namely, the Dutch, having their factory at Chinsura and the French with their factory at Chandernagor. Siraj-ud-Daula became the Nawab of Bengal in 1756. Apart from having several foes in the family who were not happy with the succession, he was immature and lacked adequate skills to tackle the situation. In the South, the English East India Company and the French were vying against each other. Without seeking Nawab Siraj-ud-Daulah\u2019s consent, the English began to build fortifications in Calcutta. They even chose to disregard the Nawab\u2019s order to curtail augmentation of their military resources and abuse the use of dastaks granted to them by the firman of 1717. Also, Company servants began misusing the concessions granted by the firman of 1717 by extending the privileges over their private trade too. Causing further economic loss to Bengal, the officials began to profit by selling off the dastaks to the Indian merchants. Another cause of discontentment towards the English for Siraj was their conscious move to give protection to Siraj\u2019s foe Krishna Das, son of Raja Rajballava. The intrigue between the Nawabs of Bengal and the British was to play a vital role in the emergence of the British as the paramount power later on in the century.",

Rather, it would seem that the overall military effort reflected the Nawab\u2019s anxiety to defend his political authority at a time when it was being steadily undermined by the alien company. For the Company, Awadh was too important and lucrative a province to be left alone. Its vast amount of revenue could be used to subsidize the company\u2019s armies. In carefully planned stages, the company stepped up its fiscal demands. In 1773, the first definitive treaty was concluded between Awadh and the English East India Company. By this treaty, the Nawab agreed to pay ` 2,10,000 monthly for each brigade of company troops that would remain present in Awadh or Allahabad. This provision established the beginning of Awadh\u2019s chronic indebtedness to the Company and represented the initial British thrust into the region\u2019s political system.",

It was also in these years, ironically enough, that the emergence of a provincial cultural identity centered on the new court and capital at Lucknow (the capital had been shifted from Fyzabad) was more clearly identifiable than before. Asaf-ud-Daula\u2019s succession to the throne in 1775 went without a hitch notwithstanding the hostility of some of Shuja\u2019 s courtiers and of the opposition faction of his brother Saadat Ali, the Governor of Rohilkhand. Soon, however, under the stewardship of Murtaza Khan (Asaf\u2019s favourite who received the exalted title of Mukhtar-ud-Daula), the stability of the existing political set up was strengthened as older nobles and generals were displaced. Furthermore, Mukhtar allowed the Company to negotiate a treaty with the Nawab ceding to English control the territories surrounding Benaras, north to Jaunpur and west to Allahabad, then held by Chait Singh. The treaty also fixed a larger subsidy than before for the Company brigade and excluded the Mughal emperor from all future Anglo-Nawabi transactions. Finally all diplomatic transactions and foreign intelligence were to be controlled by the English through the resident at the Nawab\u2019s court. The disintegration of the political system, the blatant intervention of the English in Awadh\u2019s affairs and Asaf-ud-Daula\u2019s excessively indulgent disposition and disregard of political affairs alarmed a sizeable section of the Awadh nobility. The situation worsened as troops were in arrears and at places mutinied. These acts of disturbance and lawlessness smoothened the way for British intervention.

After the death of Shivaji (1680), various Maratha chiefs carved their own independent kingdoms. During the Peshwaship of Baji Rao I (1720\u20131740) they were loosely attached with the Peshwa, but after the debacle of Panipat (January 14, 1761) they became enemy of each other and plundered each other\u2019s territory. \u2022 Low morale: During the period of Shivaji and the Maratha war of independence, the morale of the Maratha state was very high which enabled them to resist the imperial armies of the Mughals. In the absence of strong leadership, the moral of the army was low and the soldiers often fled from the battlefield. \u2022 Unstable economy: The economy of the Maratha state was not on a sound basis.

There was a revival of the Maratha power in North India under Peshwa Madhav Rao I (1761\u20131972). After the death of Najib- ud-daula (1770) who \u2018administered Delhi as Abdali\u2019s agent after Panipat, the Marathas .restored the exiled Mughal emperor Shah Alam II to the capital of his ancestors (1972).

Each factory had an officer who was assisted by a number of persons appointed by the Portuguese king. He was the agent of the crown to promote economic, financial and administrative activities of all sorts. In all situations Portuguese national interests were of paramount consideration. Factories also required protection from hostile elements. Therefore, to consolidate and strengthen their power the Portuguese also attempted to fortify their factories. A chain of factories and fortresses came into existence for the support of the maritime trade conducted by the Portuguese. These fortified centres were expected to serve the Portuguese to check the movements of vessels owned by others and to function as areas for the reserve of military and naval forces.
